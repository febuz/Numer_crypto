# Numer_crypto Project Status

## Completed Tasks

1. **Data Processing Framework Enhancements**
   - Replaced pandas with Polars for improved performance
   - Added PySpark integration for large-scale data processing
   - Implemented RAPIDS for GPU-accelerated data operations

2. **Hardware Configuration**
   - Updated settings.py to support high-memory (640GB) configuration
   - Added support for multi-GPU setups (3x RTX5000 GPUs)
   - Implemented dynamic resource detection for both CPU and GPU

3. **Machine Learning Framework**
   - Implemented XGBoost with GPU acceleration
   - Added LightGBM with GPU acceleration support
   - Created basic H2O and H2O Sparkling Water integration

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Created hardware capability testing scripts
   - Implemented synthetic dataset generation for testing
   - Developed model performance comparison tools (CPU vs GPU)
   - Created H2O AutoML test with synthetic data

5. **Environment Management**
   - Created setup scripts for both conda and venv environments
   - Added pip requirements for all dependencies
   - Implemented minimal testing environment for quick verification
   - Added Java 11 configuration for H2O Sparkling Water compatibility

## Current Issues

1. **H2O Sparkling Water**
   - Successfully tested with Java 11 and Java 17 (confirmed working)
   - H2O Sparkling requires Java 8-17 (Java 21 not supported)
   - Java 17 requires additional module options (--add-opens for network modules)
   - H2O standalone also works with Java 21 with strict_version_check=False

2. **LightGBM GPU Performance**
   - GPU acceleration currently slower than CPU (0.36x speedup) for small datasets
   - Need to optimize for larger datasets where GPU will have an advantage

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Full environment setup runs into timeout issues
   - Need to create a more efficient environment setup process

## Next Steps

1. **Complete ML Framework Integration**
   - Optimize LightGBM GPU performance for larger datasets
   - Create comprehensive testing framework for all ML models
   - Configure memory settings for optimal H2O Sparkling Water performance

2. **Data Pipeline Enhancement**
   - Improve data loading and processing with Polars/RAPIDS
   - Implement distributed processing with PySpark
   - Add automated feature engineering pipeline

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - Create end-to-end training workflows
   - Implement model evaluation and comparison tools
   - Add hyperparameter tuning with GPU acceleration

4. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Complete documentation for all components
   - Add unit tests for critical functionality
   - Create benchmark suite for performance evaluation
